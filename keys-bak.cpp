In this case we will set it to not share with other programs (DISCL_EXCLUSIVE). This way if you press a key only your application can see that input and no other application will have access to it. However if you want other applications to have access to keyboard input while your program is running you can set it to non-exclusive (DISCL_NONEXCLUSIVE). Now the print screen key works again and other running applications can be controlled by the keyboard and so forth. Just remember that if it is non-exclusive and you are running in a windowed mode then you will need to check for when the device loses focus and when it re-gains that focus so it can re-acquire the device for use again. This focus loss generally happens when other windows become the main focus over your window or your window is minimized.

If it fails reading the keyboard then it can be for one of five different reasons. The only two that we want to recover from are if the focus is lost or if it becomes un-acquired. If this is the case we call acquire each frame until we do get control back. The window may be minimized in which case Acquire will fail, but once the window comes to the foreground again then Acquire will succeed and we will be able to read the keyboard state. The other three error types I don't want to recover from in this tutorial.
